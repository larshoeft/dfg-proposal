## Introduction

Students often enter the classroom with preconceptions or alternative conceptions—commonly referred to as misconceptions—about scientific phenomena. These misconceptions typically develop through everyday experiences or even as a result of prior classroom instruction, and while they may be functional in daily reasoning, they often contradict scientific explanations. Achieving a *conceptual change*, that is, a shift from intuitive or naïve conceptions to scientifically accurate understanding, is known to be a challenging and gradual process [@chi2008_international; @disessa2017_conceptual; @vosniadou1994_capturing]. Moreover, research suggests that alternative and scientific conceptions can coexist for extended periods before a stable conceptual restructuring occurs.

To facilitate conceptual change, instructional approaches such as *refutation texts* and *dialogical argumentation* have proven effective. Refutation texts explicitly present a common misconception, refute it, and then introduce the scientifically accepted concept. Dialogical argumentation engages learners in discussing and reasoning about conflicting viewpoints. Both methods are designed to induce *cognitive incongruence*, a state of mental conflict that arises when new information challenges existing beliefs.

Experiencing such incongruence can evoke *epistemic emotions*, which are emotions directly related to knowledge acquisition and cognitive processing. These emotions can either enhance learning—such as curiosity and enjoyment—or hinder it—such as frustration and anxiety [@pekrun2024_controlvalue; @muis2018_role].

The present study aims to investigate the combined use of refutation texts and dialogical argumentation in promoting and consolidating conceptual change. Furthermore, it seeks to explore the role of epistemic emotions in mediating or moderating these learning processes, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of the emotional dynamics involved in conceptual change.

### Refutation Texts

-   "findings show a consistent and statistically significant advantage of refutation texts over non-refutation texts in controlled experiments confronting scientific misconceptions. We also found that moderators neither enhanced nor diminished the impact of the refutation texts." [@danielson2025_effectiveness]
-   "refutation text is associated with a positive, moderate effect (*g* = 0.41, *p* \< .001) compared to other learning conditions. This effect was consistent and robust across a wide variety of contexts" [@schroeder2022_refutation]
-   "Methodological issues we identified centered on problems of using a single topic (or very few) within a study, the role of testing in conceptual change, and the durability of change beyond an immediate posttest." [@zengilowski2021_critical]
-   "A crucial factor impeding science learning (from texts) are misconceptions. To encourage active engagement with these misconceptions, refutation texts have been established as a promising tool. Unfortunately, poor readers usually do not benefit from these texts. Hence, graphic organizers in combination with refutation texts can be considered to scaffold those readers. To further support consolidation of newly learned information into the long-term memory, a variety of instructional tasks can be implemented." [@kroger2025_promoting]

### Argumentation

-   "Furthermore, the deeper integration of computer technology and argumentation needs to be strengthened in the future." [@fu2025_effectiveness]
-   "It is proved that online argumentation activities have an upper-middle positive effect on students’ "Learn to Argue" (Hedges’ g = 0.603, P = 0.000) and "Argue to Learn" (Hedges’ g = 0.596, P = 0.000) abilities. Finally, the results of moderator analysis showed that the natural science issues have the greatest effect. Compared with higher education, online scientific argumentation is of greater value in K-12 classroom." [@zhou2024_learn]
-   "Those who read congruent texts showed greater knowledge gains and were more likely to think causally than those in the incongruent group." [@danielson2023_can]

### Epistemic Emotions

-   "epistemic emotions are triggered by cognitive states involving discrepancy, or conflict, between active schemas and incoming information, or gap in one's knowledge" [@nerantzaki2021_epistemic]
-   "Accordingly, epistemic emotions that learners experience when they begin to form a definition of a task may provide cues to learners that particular goals may or may not be achievable. Individuals may then adjust goals as a function of those cues (downgrading or upgrading). Of course, epistemic emotions that arise during the enactment or evaluation phases may subsequently lead learners to revise previous goals. For example, as a learner progresses in a task and achieves one of the epistemic aims, he or she may revise that goal and set the standard even higher than the original. In addition, epistemic emotions may serve as cues to learners to set particular plans for carrying out the task. If a learner experiences confusion surrounding the parameters of a mathematics problem, that individual may then plan to construct a concept map of that problem and coordinate informational sources between the problem text and the concept map to reduce confusion (Muis, Psaradellis, et al., 2015)." [@muis2018_role]
-   confusion -\> frustration -\> no learning gains [@muis2025_confusion]

### Research Questions

1.  Does engaging in dialogic argumentation contribute to the consolidation conceptual understanding from refutation texts on the concept of chemical reactions?
2.  Does the conceptual stance of discussion partners in dialogic argumentation (e.g., both accurate vs. one accurate and one misconceived) influence conceptual understanding?
3.  Do epistemic emotions mediate the relationship between the conceptual stance of discussion partners in dialogic argumentation and conceptual understanding?
4.  Does a brief argumentation training intervention enhance conceptual understanding during dialogic argumentation, and is this effect mediated by reductions in confusion and frustration?
