# Learning Chemistry through Dialogic Argumentation


## Introduction

Students often enter the classroom with preconceptions or alternative
conceptions—commonly referred to as misconceptions—about scientific
phenomena. These misconceptions typically develop through everyday
experiences or even as a result of prior classroom instruction, and
while they may be functional in daily reasoning, they often contradict
scientific explanations. Achieving a *conceptual change*, that is, a
shift from intuitive or naïve conceptions to scientifically accurate
understanding, is known to be a challenging and gradual process (Chi &
Vosniadou, 2008; diSessa, 2017; Vosniadou, 1994). Moreover, research
suggests that alternative and scientific conceptions can coexist for
extended periods before a stable conceptual restructuring occurs.

To facilitate conceptual change, instructional approaches such as
*refutation texts* and *dialogical argumentation* have proven effective.
Refutation texts explicitly present a common misconception, refute it,
and then introduce the scientifically accepted concept. Dialogical
argumentation engages learners in discussing and reasoning about
conflicting viewpoints. Both methods are designed to induce *cognitive
incongruence*, a state of mental conflict that arises when new
information challenges existing beliefs.

Experiencing such incongruence can evoke *epistemic emotions*, which are
emotions directly related to knowledge acquisition and cognitive
processing. These emotions can either enhance learning—such as curiosity
and enjoyment—or hinder it—such as frustration and anxiety (Muis et al.,
2018; Pekrun, 2024).

The present study aims to investigate the combined use of refutation
texts and dialogical argumentation in promoting and consolidating
conceptual change. Furthermore, it seeks to explore the role of
epistemic emotions in mediating or moderating these learning processes,
thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of the emotional dynamics
involved in conceptual change.

### Refutation Texts

- “findings show a consistent and statistically significant advantage of
  refutation texts over non-refutation texts in controlled experiments
  confronting scientific misconceptions. We also found that moderators
  neither enhanced nor diminished the impact of the refutation texts.”
  (Danielson et al., 2025)
- “refutation text is associated with a positive, moderate effect (*g* =
  0.41, *p* \< .001) compared to other learning conditions. This effect
  was consistent and robust across a wide variety of contexts”
  (Schroeder & Kucera, 2022)
- “Methodological issues we identified centered on problems of using a
  single topic (or very few) within a study, the role of testing in
  conceptual change, and the durability of change beyond an immediate
  posttest.” (Zengilowski et al., 2021)
- “A crucial factor impeding science learning (from texts) are
  misconceptions. To encourage active engagement with these
  misconceptions, refutation texts have been established as a promising
  tool. Unfortunately, poor readers usually do not benefit from these
  texts. Hence, graphic organizers in combination with refutation texts
  can be considered to scaffold those readers. To further support
  consolidation of newly learned information into the long-term memory,
  a variety of instructional tasks can be implemented.” (Kröger et al.,
  2025)

### Argumentation

- “Furthermore, the deeper integration of computer technology and
  argumentation needs to be strengthened in the future.” (Fu & Zhan,
  2025)
- “It is proved that online argumentation activities have an
  upper-middle positive effect on students’”Learn to Argue” (Hedges’ g =
  0.603, P = 0.000) and “Argue to Learn” (Hedges’ g = 0.596, P = 0.000)
  abilities. Finally, the results of moderator analysis showed that the
  natural science issues have the greatest effect. Compared with higher
  education, online scientific argumentation is of greater value in K-12
  classroom.” (Zhou, 2024)
- “Those who read congruent texts showed greater knowledge gains and
  were more likely to think causally than those in the incongruent
  group.” (Danielson et al., 2023)

### Epistemic Emotions

- “epistemic emotions are triggered by cognitive states involving
  discrepancy, or conflict, between active schemas and incoming
  information, or gap in one’s knowledge” (Nerantzaki et al., 2021)
- “Accordingly, epistemic emotions that learners experience when they
  begin to form a definition of a task may provide cues to learners that
  particular goals may or may not be achievable. Individuals may then
  adjust goals as a function of those cues (downgrading or upgrading).
  Of course, epistemic emotions that arise during the enactment or
  evaluation phases may subsequently lead learners to revise previous
  goals. For example, as a learner progresses in a task and achieves one
  of the epistemic aims, he or she may revise that goal and set the
  standard even higher than the original. In addition, epistemic
  emotions may serve as cues to learners to set particular plans for
  carrying out the task. If a learner experiences confusion surrounding
  the parameters of a mathematics problem, that individual may then plan
  to construct a concept map of that problem and coordinate
  informational sources between the problem text and the concept map to
  reduce confusion (Muis, Psaradellis, et al., 2015).” (Muis et al.,
  2018)
- confusion -\> frustration -\> no learning gains (Muis et al., 2025)

### Research Questions

1.  Does engaging in dialogic argumentation contribute to the
    consolidation conceptual understanding from refutation texts on the
    concept of chemical reactions?
2.  Does the conceptual stance of discussion partners in dialogic
    argumentation (e.g., both accurate vs. one accurate and one
    misconceived) influence conceptual understanding?
3.  Do epistemic emotions mediate the relationship between the
    conceptual stance of discussion partners in dialogic argumentation
    and conceptual understanding?
4.  Does a brief argumentation training intervention enhance conceptual
    understanding during dialogic argumentation, and is this effect
    mediated by reductions in confusion and frustration?

keystrokes)?
